# CS732 / SE750 Quiz, Semester One, 2022
This quiz is given in two parts. The first part involves completing a simple MERN-stack application, while the second part involves answering written questions. These sections are located in the [PartA](./PartA) and [PartB](./PartB) folders, respectively.

Each half of this quiz has equal weighting, and combined is worth **20%** of your overall grade for the course (i.e. 10% each).

## Submission instructions
Your GitHub Classroom repository for this quiz will serve as your submission - specifically, the last commit to the `main` branch, as of the quiz due date (see the Canvas page for details regarding the due date). Make sure not to submit any unneccessary files (e.g. the `node_modules`) folder - though the provided `.gitignore` should greatly assist with this. For part one, make sure that `package.json` and `yarn.lock` are both committed and up-to-date with any changes you make to them (for example, if you install any extra `npm` packages).

The quiz is open for submission for just over 24 hours, and you may use all of that time to complete the quiz, if you wish. However, we estimate that the actual time required will be between *two to three hours*.

## Part A
For part A, complete the application located in the [PartA](./PartA) folder, by following the instructions in [Part A's Readme](./PartA/README.md).

Part A contains several practical steps, worth a total of 30 points. Part A in total comprises 50% of your total grade for this quiz.

## Part B
For part B, complete the Word document located in the [PartB](./PartB) folder. Make sure it is committed to GitHub Classroom along with your Part A solution.

Part B contains several written questions, worth a total of 30 points. Part B in total comprises 50% of your total grade for this quiz.
